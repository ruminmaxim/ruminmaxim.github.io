                            <span>A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;components were poorly assembled, were not responsive, and had useless memory-cluttering layers.</span>

                                There were a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;components made &laquo;just in&nbsp;case&raquo; (for example, variations for a&nbsp;dark theme, although there was no&nbsp;dark theme at&nbsp;the moment).

            <h4>Final decision</h4>
            <span>In&nbsp;view of&nbsp;all these problems, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;new library because redesigning old components took as&nbsp;much time (or&nbsp;even more) than creating new ones (taking into account the problems that were in&nbsp;the outdated library). It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;start over and avoid previous mistakes.</span>

            <h4>Design Library Research</h4>
            <span>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the decision to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;new library was made, we&nbsp;started our research with benchmarking. I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;over 20&nbsp;different design systems and libraries, the main aspects we&nbsp;wanted are:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>The structure of&nbsp;the file and pages, how the components are grouped.</li>
                <li>How components are assembled.</li>
                <li>How components are decomposed in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the atomic approach.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="sectionText sectionTextAdditional">
            <span>We&nbsp;also interviewed some other designers in&nbsp;our company who have dealt with extensive project libraries. Not only did they share some useful knowledge in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;structuring, but also in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;useful tools and techniques.</span>

            <div class="sectionTextAndImageText sectionText70">
                <b>Design Library Structure</b>
                <span>We&nbsp;knew for sure that the option with all components on&nbsp;one page would not suit&nbsp;us, because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;navigate, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;use different pages. There was a&nbsp;question of&nbsp;choosing a&nbsp;grouping of&nbsp;components.</span>
                <span>After going through a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;design systems, we&nbsp;settled on&nbsp;a&nbsp;structure grouped by&nbsp;type: banners, cards, buttons, etc.</span>
                <span>But we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;group not only components, we&nbsp;also had styles, design tokens and guidelines. This is&nbsp;how two main sections of&nbsp;our library appeared: Foundations and Components.</span>
                <span>We&nbsp;also decided to&nbsp;flag pages to&nbsp;show the status of&nbsp;being ready. If&nbsp;the component is&nbsp;completed, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;marked in&nbsp;green, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;progress and not completed, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;marked in&nbsp;yellow.</span>

                <span>The atomic design approach was used in&nbsp;the legacy library, but we&rsquo;ve taken it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the next level with the new one. Combined with variants, our library became very flexible. Now we&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;design organisms like filter panels, where the smallest atom was a&nbsp;checkbox.</span>

            <h4>Workflow Changes</h4>
            <span>Library refactoring wouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;that effective without changing the workflow. Here are some changes that made designers&rsquo; life easier.</span>
            <ol>
                <li>Evolutionary Development. In&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;waste time on&nbsp;components that may never be&nbsp;used, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;develop our library in&nbsp;an&nbsp;evolutionary way, and create only those components that are needed.</li>
                <li>Component quality control. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;page called &laquo;To&nbsp;Review&raquo; where the designer posts a&nbsp;new component to&nbsp;be&nbsp;added to&nbsp;the library. I, as&nbsp;responsible for the library and review, checked the assembly of&nbsp;the component, the necessary states and descriptions.</li>
                <li>No&nbsp;detaching. Strict component usage policy. In&nbsp;the final design review phase, we&nbsp;make sure that components from the library are used, otherwise missing components are added to&nbsp;the library.</li>
                <li>Specifications. Enhanced practices with specifications for developers.</li>

            <h4>The process of adding components and reviewing</h4>
            <span>New services and screens were made by&nbsp;a&nbsp;large number of&nbsp;designers from different pools. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the following problems could appear:</span>
            <ol>
                <li>Duplicate components. Sometimes a&nbsp;designer can create a&nbsp;new component even though a&nbsp;similar one may already exist, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;more logical to&nbsp;add a&nbsp;new state to&nbsp;it.</li>
                <li>The naming of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new component can be&nbsp;poorly chosen.</li>
                <li>A&nbsp;component may be&nbsp;assembled incorrectly, contain empty layers or&nbsp;layers with the wrong naming, be&nbsp;non-adaptive and not have all states.</li>
                <li>A&nbsp;component may be&nbsp;assembled incorrectly, contain empty layers or&nbsp;layers with the wrong naming, be&nbsp;non-adaptive and not have all states.</li>
                <li>A&nbsp;component may be&nbsp;placed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;library in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;find&nbsp;it.</li>
            </ol>
            <span>Therefore, it&nbsp;was decided to&nbsp;conduct a&nbsp;review of&nbsp;the components. When a&nbsp;new component appeared, the designer had to&nbsp;show it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;meeting, and if&nbsp;this was not possible, then place it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the To&nbsp;Review tab. Once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while, I&nbsp;or a&nbsp;colleague checked this tab, commented or&nbsp;made changes, after which the component was migrated to&nbsp;its corresponding page.</span>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Proper assembly of&nbsp;components greatly speeds up&nbsp;the design work. Designers don&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;tweak components or&nbsp;reinvent the wheel because components are responsive and behave as&nbsp;expected in&nbsp;layouts.</li>
                <li>Variations is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge plus, as&nbsp;designers don&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;look through the entire library to&nbsp;find what they need.</li>
                <li>The new library structure has made navigation easier. It&nbsp;has become not only easier to&nbsp;find suitable components for layouts, but also to&nbsp;minimize the error of&nbsp;creating duplicate components.</li>
                <li>Getting rid of&nbsp;unnecessary layers and states has speeded up&nbsp;work in&nbsp;Figma, as&nbsp;files take up&nbsp;less space.</li>
                <li>The developers appreciated the new library. They noted the usability, the quality of&nbsp;the description of&nbsp;the guides, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;all the states of&nbsp;the components. Even though we&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t have a&nbsp;full-fledged design system, it&nbsp;made it&nbsp;more convenient for developers to&nbsp;work with layouts, and reduced refinement and communication time.</li>
                <li>The design library assumed a&nbsp;redaction policy for articles and events, which contributed to&nbsp;the preparation of&nbsp;well-formed articles by&nbsp;content managers.</li>
