                Transformation of&nbsp;the city portal
                </h1>
            <div class="sectionText">
                <h4>Background</h4>
                <span>Norilsk Nickel is&nbsp;the world&rsquo;s largest producer of&nbsp;nickel and palladium, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;city-forming enterprise. Most of&nbsp;the inhabitants of&nbsp;Norilsk are employees of&nbsp;this company. Life in&nbsp;northern cities is&nbsp;fraught with difficulties, citizens live in&nbsp;extreme weather conditions, where temperatures in&nbsp;winter can drop to &minus;40 &deg; C&nbsp;and it&nbsp;affects their way of&nbsp;life.In such low temperatures, schools are moving to&nbsp;remote work, and roads to&nbsp;the airport can be&nbsp;closed in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;snowstorm.</span>
                <span>Norilsk Nickel came up&nbsp;with the idea to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;aggregator of&nbsp;online services for residents of&nbsp;northern cities in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;improve the quality of&nbsp;life of&nbsp;citizens by&nbsp;providing various online services&nbsp;&mdash; from telemedicine to&nbsp;distance education.</span>
                <span>So&nbsp;the city portal got off to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fast start and launched an&nbsp;MVP with a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;services. The portal had been in&nbsp;operation for a&nbsp;year when it&nbsp;was decided that it&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;revised.</span>

                    <h4>Team</h4>
                    <span>
                        <h5>Customer Team</h5>The client&rsquo;s team consisted of&nbsp;product owners and stakeholders responsible for specific things such as&nbsp;market research, legal and security consulting. Each product owner was responsible for a&nbsp;specific service area such as&nbsp;education, telemedicine, entertainment, etc.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h5>Out Team</h5>Development teams were responsible for different areas. One of&nbsp;them was engaged in&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;platform functions that influenced the operation of&nbsp;the entire portal, the other worked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;mobile application.
                    </span>
                    <span>While Upstream was responsible for providing development-ready requirements and layouts. It&nbsp;included project managers, architects, business analysts and designers.</span>

                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <span>After conducting interviews with stakeholders and product owners, the design team discovered that the main problem was that users were hardly exploring the homepage and the site itself. We&nbsp;had to&nbsp;figure out why this was happening and come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;solution.
                    </span>
                    <span>After several iterations of&nbsp;meetings, we&nbsp;determined the main goal of&nbsp;the redesign was to&nbsp;increase user engagement on&nbsp;the home page. And the metrics to&nbsp;measure this were as&nbsp;follows:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Average number of&nbsp;pages per session.</li>
                        <li>Bounce rate.</li>
                        <li>Average session duration.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="sectionText sectionTextAdditionalYellow">
                <span>ðŸ’¡Note
                </span>
                <span>Redesign was carried out for the entire portal, but the main emphasis was placed on&nbsp;the main page as&nbsp;the most informative.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="sectionTextAndImageRight">
                <div class="sectionTextAndImageText sectionText70">
                    <h4>Process</h4>
                    <span>To&nbsp;achieve our goal, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;follow a&nbsp;pretty standard design process:</span>
                    <div class="sectionText">
                        <ol>
                            <li>

                                <span>First, we&nbsp;study the problem and collect all available input information.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Define</span><br>
                                <span>Then we&nbsp;identify the issues that we&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Ideate</span><br>
                                <span>In&nbsp;the next step, we&nbsp;generate ideas to&nbsp;resolve the issues.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <span>And last but not least we&nbsp;deliver the final result, test it&nbsp;and make it&nbsp;scalable by&nbsp;setting up&nbsp;the library.</span>

                    <span><h5>Scrolling Statistics</h5>The statistics of&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;scrolling on&nbsp;the main page show that users would not scroll down and explore the content.
                    </span>
                    
                    <span><h5>Click Maps</h5>Users would mostly engage with the menu at&nbsp;the top, but wouldn&rsquo;t explore the page itself.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Useful widgets for weather, school restrictions and news.</li>

                    <h4>Issues Coverage</h4>
                    <span>Having performed the research, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the following issues:</span>
                    <span>
                        <h5>
                            Long main page
                        </h5>
                        The first screen was rather impractical, the only interactive elements were in&nbsp;the menu. A&nbsp;huge part of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was the background image. The overall page was rather large, one block could fill the entire screen, and the user had to&nbsp;scroll the page a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;see the content. Lots of&nbsp;unnecessary blocks and banners.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h5>
                            Chaotic order of blocks
                        </h5>
                        The main page had been developing evolutionary, so&nbsp;the order of&nbsp;blocks had never been analysed.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h5>
                            Lack of content
                        </h5>There are not so&nbsp;many things to&nbsp;interact with if&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t have enough content to&nbsp;engage with.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h5>
                            Blocks look similar
                        </h5>
                        News, services, events and live streams look the same&nbsp;&mdash; square tiles. This view created a&nbsp;monotonous grid, and users couldn&rsquo;t tell they were looking at&nbsp;different types of&nbsp;content.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h5>
                            Services are unclear
                        </h5>Service cards took up&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;space and did not look attractive.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <h5>
                            Services are too low
                        </h5>Even though this block is&nbsp;the essence of&nbsp;the website somehow it&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the page, where the users wouldn&rsquo;t even scroll down&nbsp;to.

                    <h4>Card Sorting</h4>
                    <span>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;prioritise the blocks of&nbsp;the main page, we&nbsp;approached a&nbsp;card sorting method. We&nbsp;asked a&nbsp;focus group to&nbsp;rate how valuable the current blocks of&nbsp;the main page are.</span>
                    <span>Having collected these insights we&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;move forward to&nbsp;the next step&nbsp;&mdash; building the informational architecture for the main page.</span>

                <h4>Layout Concepts</h4>
                <span>At&nbsp;this stage, we&nbsp;started to&nbsp;generate ideas of&nbsp;what information architecture and low-fidelity layouts might look like. We&nbsp;have created more than 20&nbsp;different concepts, not only static, but also interactive prototypes. After several iterations, we&nbsp;agreed on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them with the customer and started working on&nbsp;the visual side.</span>

                    <h4>High fidelity variants based on&nbsp;corporate identity</h4>
                    <span>While we&nbsp;were researching and working on&nbsp;the layout concept, another contractor prepared new branding that we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;implement into the portal design.</span>
                    <span>The main idea behind this branding was that it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;bright and eye-catching, and should reflect the lifestyle of&nbsp;modern citizens who are connected to&nbsp;technology and online services.</span>
                    <span>
                        <span class="textYellowBG">But it&nbsp;turned out that on&nbsp;the basis of&nbsp;this corporate identity is&nbsp;not easy to&nbsp;build an&nbsp;interface and pick up&nbsp;the&nbsp;UI.</span>

                    </span>
                    <span>Colored bars and coats of&nbsp;arms looked good on&nbsp;large elements: patterns, large pictures, in&nbsp;social networks. But on&nbsp;the portal, where there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;small elements, panels, navigation, this style strongly interfered. We&nbsp;felt it&nbsp;ourselves, it&nbsp;was confirmed by&nbsp;the customer, and it&nbsp;was confirmed by&nbsp;surveys within the company.</span>
                    <span>Below are various trial options for implementing this style on&nbsp;the platform.</span>

                <span>In&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;demonstrations and discussions, we&nbsp;also adjusted the original prototype by&nbsp;simplifying and changing some mechanics.</span>
